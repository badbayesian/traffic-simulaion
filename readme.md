# This repo contains my final project for parallel programming class in go.  


## Traffic simulation
All datasets are generated from running the experiment

usage statement:
The experiment is defined in /main where a user runs go run simulation.go with the following flags.
`p = flag.Int("p", 4, "Number of threads")
n = flag.Int("n", 100, "Number of experiments")
r = flag.Int("r", 100, "Number of rounds in experiment")
c = flag.Int("c", 1000, "Number of cars per experiment")
s = flag.Float64("s", 1, "Penalty of traffic")
size = flag.Int("size", 10, "Size of graph")
t = flag.String("t", "city","Type of Experiment (complete, random, city)")
loc = flag.String("loc", "tmp", "Save location for json")`

Note that the results of the experiment (the weighted graphs) will be saved in data while the timing report from generate/process.batch will be saved in report/report.txt
